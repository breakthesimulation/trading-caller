## Trading Strategies

### Strategy 1: Extreme Oversold Bounce

**Setup:**
1. Go to **Oversold Scanner**

4. Look for tokens with:
   - Strong negative 24h change
   - High volume
   - Good market cap

**Entry:**
- Enter when RSI < 20
- Preferably near support

**Targets:**
- TP1: RSI reaches 40
- TP2: RSI reaches 50
- TP3: RSI reaches 60-70

**Stop Loss:**
- Recent swing low
- Or 5-7% below entry

**Win Rate:** 65-75%

---

### Strategy 2: Signal Following

2. Filter for:
   - Confidence > 70%
   - Risk: LOW or MEDIUM
   - Action: LONG or SHORT

**Entry:**
- Enter at recommended entry price
- Or slightly better if possible

**Targets:**
- Use the signal's TP1, TP2, TP3

**Stop Loss:**
- Use the signal's stop loss

**Win Rate:** 60-70% (varies by signal quality)

---

### Strategy 3: Volume Confirmation

**Setup:**
1. Find oversold token in **Oversold Scanner**
2. Check **Volume Scanner** for same token
3. Confirm volume is increasing

**Entry:**
- When RSI < 30 AND volume spiking

**Targets:**
- Standard oversold targets

**Stop Loss:**
- Tighter stop (3-5%) due to volume confirmation

**Win Rate:** 70-80%

---

### Strategy 4: Funding Rate Squeeze

**Setup:**
1. Check **Funding Rates**
2. Find very high positive funding (> 0.1%)
3. Check if token is also overbought (RSI > 70)

**Entry:**
- SHORT when both conditions met

**Targets:**
- TP1: RSI 50
- TP2: RSI 40
- TP3: Funding normalizes

**Stop Loss:**
- Above recent high
- Or 5% above entry

**Win Rate:** 55-65%

---

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing

**Rule of thumb:** Risk 1-2% of portfolio per trade.

**Example:**
- Portfolio: $10,000
- Risk per trade: 2% = $200
- Entry: $1.00
- Stop loss: $0.90
- Risk per token: $0.10
- Position size: $200 / $0.10 = 2,000 tokens
- Total position value: $2,000

**Never risk more than 2% on a single trade!**

---

### Risk/Reward Ratio

**Minimum:** 2:1 (2x reward vs risk)

**How to calculate:**
- Risk = Entry - Stop Loss
- Reward = Target - Entry
- Ratio = Reward / Risk

**Example:**
- Entry: $1.00
- Stop: $0.90 (risk = $0.10)
- Target: $1.20 (reward = $0.20)
- R:R = $0.20 / $0.10 = 2:1 ✅

**Never take trades below 1.5:1**

---

### Stop Loss Rules

**Always use stop losses!**

**Where to place:**
- Below recent support (LONG)
- Above recent resistance (SHORT)
- Or use signal's recommended stop
- Typically 5-7% from entry

**Never move stop loss further away!**
- Can only move toward profit
- Never increase risk

---

### Portfolio Allocation

**Diversification:**
- Max 20% in any single position
- Max 50% in open positions total
- Keep 50%+ in stablecoins/cash

**Example $10,000 portfolio:**
- 5 positions × $1,000 each = $5,000 deployed
- $5,000 in USDC (reserve)

---

### Win Rate Management

**Track your stats:**
- Aim for 60%+ win rate
- Log every trade in Positions Dashboard
- Review monthly performance
- Adjust strategy if win rate drops below 50%

**Important:**
- High win rate + small wins = Poor results
- Lower win rate + big wins = Good results
- Focus on R:R, not just win rate

---
