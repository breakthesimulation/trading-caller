## 🔥 **SLIDE 2: The Problem**

# The Crypto Trading Problem

## 📊 **Market Chaos**

- **Emotional trading** leads to buying high, selling low
- **False signals** from low-quality analysis tools

## 🤖 **Existing Solutions Fail**
- **Trading bots**: Rigid rules that break in new conditions
- **Signal services**: Cherry-pick wins, hide losses
- **AI tools**: No learning, no transparency, no accountability
