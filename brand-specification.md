## Usage Guidelines

- Use the **Primary Logo** (fox mascot) for main branding, hero sections, and marketing materials.
- Use the **Wordmark** for contexts where the full mascot is not appropriate (e.g., document headers, smaller placements).
- Use the **Monogram (AF)** for favicons, app icons, and compact branding contexts.
- Primary palette colors should dominate brand materials; secondary palette colors are for accents, backgrounds, and supporting elements.
