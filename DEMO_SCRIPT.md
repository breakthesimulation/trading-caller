# Trading Caller - Demo Script (2 minutes)

## Hook (0:00-0:15)
*Screen: Trading Caller homepage*

"Trading calls are hard. You need to analyze charts, track indicators, manage risk, and stay disciplined 24/7. What if an AI agent could do all that for you?"

## The Problem (0:15-0:30)
*Screen: Show typical trading dashboard complexity*

"Most traders lose money because they:
- Miss key signals while sleeping
- Let emotions override strategy  
- Can't track performance across hundreds of tokens
- Don't learn from their mistakes"

## The Solution (0:30-1:00)
*Screen: Trading Caller Signals page*

"Trading Caller is an autonomous AI agent that:
- **Analyzes 400+ Solana tokens** every hour using RSI, MACD, volume, and trend analysis
- **Generates high-confidence trading signals** with clear entry, targets, and stop-loss levels
- **Tracks every signal's outcome** to calculate real win rates and improve over time
- **Never sleeps** - 24/7 market monitoring

*Click through features*

Look at this signal for JUP - 65% confidence LONG, entry at $0.85, three target levels, clear stop-loss. The agent calculated this from real-time data."

## Differentiation (1:00-1:30)
*Screen: Positions Dashboard*

"But here's what makes Trading Caller different:

**1. Full transparency** - Every signal is tracked. You can see the actual win rate, P&L, and performance per token. No hiding bad calls.

*Screen: Oversold Scanner*

**2. Multi-dimensional analysis** - Not just signals. We have oversold/overbought scanners, volume spike detection, funding rate analysis.

*Screen: Leaderboard*

**3. Continuous learning** - The agent tracks which indicators work best for each token and adjusts confidence weights automatically."

## Hackathon Integration (1:30-1:45)
*Screen: Code/API*

"And because this is built BY an AI agent FOR the hackathon:
- Fully autonomous - auto-registers, posts updates, engages in the forum
- Self-improving - learns from every signal outcome
- API-first - other agents can consume these signals"
