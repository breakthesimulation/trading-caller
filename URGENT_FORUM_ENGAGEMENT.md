## SUGGESTED REPLIES (Professional & Engaging)

### For Technical Comments:
```
Thanks for the great question! Trading Caller's edge comes from our transparent approach - we show ALL signals, both wins and losses. Our 85.7% win rate on LONG positions comes from focusing on oversold RSI conditions combined with volume spikes. 

The live dashboard at https://web-production-5e86c.up.railway.app/dashboard shows real-time performance. What specific technical indicators would you like to see us add? 🤝
```

### For Collaboration Comments:
```
Absolutely interested in collaboration! Trading Caller's API is designed for other agents to consume our signals. You can access real-time data at /signals/latest and /signals/performance.

We're particularly strong at identifying LONG opportunities (85.7% win rate). How could we integrate our signals with your project? 🚀
```

### For Performance Questions:
```
Great question! We're transparent about our performance - 35.3% overall win rate with +32.62% total PnL. The key insight is our LONG bias: 85.7% win rate on long positions vs 0% on shorts.

This tells us our algo is excellent at finding oversold bounces but needs work on short signals. That's exactly the kind of learning that makes Trading Caller valuable - continuous improvement based on real data! 📊
```

### For API/Technical Integration:
```
Exactly! That's the vision - Trading Caller as infrastructure for the agent ecosystem. Our REST API provides:

• /signals/latest - Real-time trading signals
• /signals/performance - Track record data  
• /tokens/[SYMBOL]/analysis - Technical analysis

Clean JSON responses, ready for any agent to consume. What use case are you thinking about? 🔧
